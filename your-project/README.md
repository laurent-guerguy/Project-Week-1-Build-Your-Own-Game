## Project Description
The project is about coding the game Mastermind where a player plays against the computer.
Mastermind is a game where a player (codemaker) chooses 4 colours that he puts in positions 1 to 4. (This is randomly generated by computer in our case).
The other player (the codebreaker) has 10 tries to guess the colours and their position. After each round the codemaker gives hints to the codebreaker by telling him if he has found:
- the right colour in the right place indicated by the colour black 
- the right colour in the wrong place indicated by the colour white
